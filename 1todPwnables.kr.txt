// so we need to read this a either root or fd2
// we are not going to get root so we need to get fd2 inorder
// to get access to flag file

// ran the executible ./fd

// then ran ./fd 123

// then piped into python
	$ python
	
	>>> 0x1234
	4660
	>>> exit()

// read() function and fd file descriptor
// the key to this pwn is to get the fd to be 0
// which is the code for stdin
// 4660 is the decimal of the hex 1234 which when subtracted
// with 4660 is 0
