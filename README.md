# Capture the Flags

These are CTFs that I've worked on and other Knight Sec practice modules. 

* Pico CTF is an intro event. It was the very first event which I 
  participated in.
  
* Pwnables.kr is a website which hosts a ton of mock pwnable ctfs. 

* RSA is a crypto project which I am working on. 
	* The initial files are concerning the Weiner RSA Attack.
	* The conclusion of the project will be written in python and 
	  will implement three other attacks to RSA encryption including
	  the coppersmith attack.
	* This project started on the heels of a the Boston Key Party CTF
	  which I participated in with Knights Sec. The particular module was
	  RSA Buffet.
